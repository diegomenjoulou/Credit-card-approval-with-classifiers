## Credit card approval prediction algorithm

The purpose of this is non comercial, just for trying out ML algorithms. Although te column names are available, the data was anonymized to protect the privacy.


### Requierments

`jupyter notebook` `pandas` `numpy` `Scikit-learn` `XGBoost`

### About

In the last few years we implemented a software based on rules that discarded or approved a credit application, but it always seemed to me that it was an inflexible model, and the features were taken into account individually and not in a combined way. So I came across this dataset and tried to implement a ML model to see if it can be predicted accurately. 

The dataset was published by [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) and was submitted by **quinlan '@' cs.su.oz.au**.

This notebook is based on [Sayak Paul's Datacamp Project](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/558).

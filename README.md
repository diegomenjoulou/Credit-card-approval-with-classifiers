## Credit card approval prediction algorithm

The purpose of this is to try out different ML classification algorithms to determine if a credit card application should be approved or recjected. 


### Requierments

`python3` `jupyter notebook` 

### Dependencies

`pandas` `numpy` `Scikit-learn` `XGBoost`

### About

In the last few years we implemented a software based on rules that discarded or approved a credit application, but it always seemed to me that it was an inflexible model, and the features were taken into account individually and not in a combined way. So I came across this dataset and tried to implement a ML model to see if it can be predicted accurately. 

The dataset was published by [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) and was submitted by **quinlan '@' cs.su.oz.au**.

This notebook is based on [Sayak Paul's Datacamp Project](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/558).
